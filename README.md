Car Price Prediction is a data science project that involves analyzing vehicle-related data to estimate car prices using machine learning models. The dataset typically includes numerical and categorical features like mileage, engine size, fuel type, brand, and age. The process starts with data preprocessing, where missing values are handled, categorical data is encoded, and numerical features are standardized. Outliers are detected and filtered using the interquartile range (IQR) method with a dynamic multiplier to prevent excessive data loss. After cleaning, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, and models like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor are trained to predict car prices. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score. Feature importance analysis helps identify the most influential factors in price determination. Finally, data visualization techniques such as bar plots illustrate the significance of various features, making the model's predictions more interpretable.
